# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

## Project Overview
Recommender systems play a crucial role in modern digital platforms by helping users discover content that matches their preferences.

In this project, I built a **Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies based on user interests using machine learning techniques.  
The goal is to provide personalized recommendations and demonstrate how recommendation engines work in real-world applications.
